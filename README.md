# **Getting Started for Hackathon**

**  
Time Estimate: 1 hour**

This section provides guidance on installing an Algorand node and the
tools that will be useful in your hackathon efforts. Happy coding\!
Download
[<span class="underline">algorandsamples.zip</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/199BdejiyA_dTRlqwOqcoubtoRG_WHwAH/view?usp=sharing)
and unzip into a folder off of your $HOME folder. In terminal type in
echo $HOME to get your Home folder location.

<span id="_Toc16786815" class="anchor"></span>**Install Algorand node  
**Time Estimate 10 minutes

In this section will install an Algorand node.

A synchronized node will be provided for this hackathon, however, you
need to install your own node, so you can do this lab exercise and
continue to work on the solution after the hackathon is over, as well as
build other solutions. Follow the instructions on how to install your
node are here:

<span class="underline"><https://developer.algorand.org/docs/introduction-installing-node>  
</span>

By default, an Algorand installation is configured to run on MainNet.
For most users, this is the desired outcome.  Developers, however, need
access to our TestNet or DevNet networks. This
[<span class="underline">guide</span>](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/switching-networks)
will walk you through how to switch networks, if you have not already
done so.

Your node may take a while to sync (several hours). You can proceed to
the following steps in the meantime, noting if the goal command does not
seem to be working, like transferring funds for example, it may be
because the node is not synced yet. To see if it is synced use this
command from terminal:

> goal node status -d \~/node/data

Note: When installing with DEB or RPM packages the binaries will be
installed in the /usr/bin and the data directory will be set to
/var/lib/algorand. It is advisable in these installs that you add the
following export to your shell config files.

> export ALGORAND\_DATA=/var/lib/algorand
> 
> When the Sync Time is zero consistently, it will be close to, if not
> all the way, synced.  
>   
> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image1.png)

**Alternatives**

The above process will take several hours to sync, so there are two
alternatives that can be used in the meantime. Each option provides an
Algod token and a Server URL. These values will be needed in your
solution code as well as the sample hackathon lab exercises.  
  
  
**Algorand Berlin Hackathon**  
  
**Option 1**

The API Token and Server address can be used in the Hackathon. Once the
hackathon is over, you will need to use your own node or one from
Purestake (see Option 2).

> API Token
> 
> ef920e2e7e002953f4b29a8af720efe8e4ecc75ff102b165e0472834b25832c1  
>   
> Server Address

<http://berlinhack.algodev.network:9100>

**Purestake Token**

**Option 2**

PureStake is offering up a token for this hackathon. You do not need to
register. This is free for use during the hackathon.

> After the Hackathon is over, you can register to receive a new token
> here:  
>   
> <https://www.purestake.com/algorand-api>
> 
> More details here:
> 
> <https://www.purestake.com/technology/algorand-services/>

***API-Key token for both TestNet and MainNet:  
***

> B3SU4KcVKi94Jap2VXkK83xx38bsv95K5UZm2lab
> 
> TestNet Server URL address:
> https://testnet-algorand.api.purestake.io/ps1
> 
> MainNet Server URL address:
> <https://mainnet-algorand.api.purestake.io/ps1>

Purestake offers many benefits including a Basic free tier as well as
Pro and Enterprise levels:

> Instant Access to Algorand API in Testnet and Mainnet

  - No wait for downloads and blockchain sync times

> API is backed by Full Archival Transaction Indexer Nodes

  - Full algod API with performant transaction queries

> Secure and Reliable Infrastructure

  - Automated Highly Available Infrastructure, Managed 24x7x365

<span id="_Toc16786816" class="anchor"></span>**Verify your data
directory**  
  
To verify where your data directory is and that you are running TestNet,
use these two commands:

1.  ps aux | grep algod

> ![A close up of a mans face Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image2.png)

2.  goal node status -d \~/node/data

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image3.png)

## Apply current updates

> cd \~/node
> 
> ./update.sh -d \~/node/data

## Private network tutorials (optional)

> Time Estimate - 5 minutes **  
> **  
> If are new to Algorand, it may be useful to spend some time doing the
> Private Network tutorials.
> 
> These tutorials will get you familiar with many of the Goal commands
> in a Private Network that you would be using to develop you solution.
> The purpose of the Private Network is to facilitate developers with a
> testing/learning environment without having to use TestNet or MainNet.
> 
> To get started in creating a Private network, in this document, see

**

## Replace tokens and addresses in the sample code. 

Time Estimate - 10 minutes

Follow the SDK install directions for each in the readme files. In all
of the examples, at some point, you will need to replace the code
placeholders with the Algod and Kmd tokens and network addresses in
each. For the node you created, these can be found here…

> From your node directory copy off values in /data for:

  - > algod.token

  - > algod.net

> From your node directory copy off values in /data/kmd-v0.5 for:

  - > kmd.token

  - > kmd.net

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image7.png)

For example, in the JavaScript SDK sample webapp test.js file update the
constants with these values:

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image8.png)

## Start two terminal sessions 

  - In the first one, start localhost using
    [<span class="underline">http-server</span>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):
    Navigate to algorandsamples folder with finder and right click to
    start terminal session in that folder. Then enter:

> http-server

  - In the other terminal session, navigate to \~/node and start up kmd
    and node (kmd may time out after a while, so don’t just assume it is
    running.)

> goal node start -d \~/node/data
> 
> goal kmd start -d \~/node/data

# **Getting started with Private Network (optional)**

5 Minutes

In this section you will learn how to create a Private Network. A
Private Network is for developers. It allows you to learn Algorand
Blockchain without having to touch either TestNet or MainNet. Code using
the Algorand SDKs, can be used to access the Private Network.  
  
This exercise is suggested for developers that are just getting started
with Algorand.

Note: the [<span class="underline">Algorand TestNet
Dispenser</span>](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/), a tool used
to send Algos to an account, only works for TestNet and not a Private
Network.

1)  Navigate to the algorandsamples folder

2)  Open networktemplate.json in VS Code and review. Note the Primary
    and Node Nodes that will be created.

> ![A close up of a map Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image11.png)

3)  In Finder, navigate to your root directory and show the directory
    structure does not have folders for Node and Primary.

4)  Run this command in Terminal from the node folder to create the
    private network.

> **goal network create -r \~/net1 -n private -t networktemplate.json**

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image12.png)

> **goal network start -r \~/net1**
> 
> **goal network status -r \~/net1**

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](images/media/image13.png)

5)  Open Finder and look at the directory structure for /net1/Node and
    /net1/Primary  
      
    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](images/media/image14.png)

6)  (Optional) The full set of Private Network tutorials are here:
    [<span class="underline">https://developer.algorand.org/docs/tutorials</span>](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/tutorials).
    This is a great learning resource.

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image15.png)

Go to
<span class="underline"><https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key></span>
to complete all the rest of the tasks in this tutorial including:

  - Creating a new wallet

  - Creating a new Account and Participation key

  - Write a raw transaction and post to algod REST server

  - Creating a multisig account

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image16.png)

7)  Once finished you can delete the private network as this is for
    learning only and cannot be used for further development, other than
    testing with SDK code. Delete the Private Network

> **goal network delete -r \~/net1**

# **Goal Command Line tools / AlgoExplorer.io**  

Time Estimate - 10 minutes

In this section we will show how to use the goal command line tool as
well as the AlgoExplorer.io.

## Goal

The goal command line tool provides access to these objects, methods and
properties.

> ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image17.png)

1.  To start a node use this command:

> goal node start -d \~/node/data  
>   
> You may need to use this command depending on your path environment
> variable.
> 
> ./goal node start -d \~/node/data

2.  To start kmd use this command:  
      
    goal kmd start -d \~/node/data

3.  To get help with goal use this command:  
      
    goal -h  
      
    ![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
    generated](images/media/image18.png)

4.  To get help with and command

> goal \[command\] -h  
>   
> For example, us this command to get help with node
> 
> goal node -h
> 
> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
> generated](images/media/image19.png)

5.  Run this to get a status. We will copy off the block number, for
    subsequent use in AlgoExplorer:

> goal node status -d \~/node/data

6.  Copy last committed block

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image20.png)

## AlgoExplorer.io

The AlgoExplorer can be used to search on blocks, transactions and
account addresses in either MainNet or TestNet.

1.  Browse to <span class="underline">[
    https://algoexplorer.io/](https://algoexplorer.io/)</span>

2.  Click on TestNet in the dropdown

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image21.png)

3.  Paste in block, press search, click on transactions. If you do not
    see any transactions, use this block: 868921

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

4)  Install the JavaScript SDK using the instructions on the readme
    file.

5)  You make need to update the algosdk.min.js that is included in the
    demo zip, from the SDK clone/zip. But, if you do update, use the
    sample code on GitHub to stay in sync.

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

    All of this functionality is accomplished in a little over 200 lines
    of code\! How about that\!” (Applause) ☺

<!-- end list -->

1.  Open test.js

2.  Note atoken

3.  Note kmdtoken

4.  If running localhost, see debug console output after scrolling thru
    code, this should be the same as seen when running the demo.

### Encode/Decode Note Field

10) Two other function to note in the code are for encoding and decoding
    the free form Note Field. This field is used to create Layer 2
    solutions. Encode it on submit transaction and decode it when
    needed.

<!-- end list -->

1)  Open test.js

2)  Locate the submit transaction code

3)  Look for the encodeObj method

### Node Example: Retrieving Latest Block Information  

11) To retrieve the latest block’s information using Node, you would use
    the algod client wrapper functions shown below.

const algosdk = require('algosdk');

//Retrieve the token, server and port values for your installation in
the algod.net

//and algod.token files within the data directory

const atoken =
"d60cb951132a5fed9dde1abeadd4ea02b2c8d9815ee1eb1cb932941eaa3821c8";

const aserver = "http://127.0.0.1";

const aport = 8080;

const algodclient = new algosdk.Algod(atoken, aserver, aport);

(async () =\> {

let lastround = (await algodclient.status()).lastRound;

let block = (await algodclient.block(lastround));

console.log( block );

})().catch(e =\> {

console.log(e);

});

    section</span>**](#_heading=h.28h4qwu)

> <span id="bookmark=id.3ygebqi" class="anchor"></span>**Go SDK  
> **Time Estimate - 20 minutes

1)  **If using GO, Add the algorandsamples (or the directory you
    unzipped the hackathon code samples to) to the GOPATH environment
    variable**

Add these two line by editing your bash\_profile and then restart your
IDE and terminal sessions:  
  
GOPATH=\~/go:\~/algorandsamples/mygodemo/

export GOPATH

2)  To edit the .bash\_profile to add the above statements, quit
    and restart terminal and Visual Studio Code. This file is located
    in your home directory and you may need to type in command + shift +
    . to see it in Finder or opening the file in your editor, as it is
    hidden. 

3)  **For the Go samples, open folder for mygodemo into VS Code or you
    favorite IDE  
    **  
    Or just open the go.code-workspace in the algorandsamples folder
    with VS Code. **  
    **

4)  The Go **launch.json** file should be similar to this:

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](images/media/image38.png)

5)  In this step we will create an algodclient using the Go SDK. We will
    create the algod client and fetch node status information, and then
    a specific block. Optional Go samples are listed below as well.

6)  In the algorandsamples folder Open go.code-workspace or the mygocode
    folder in VS Code

If you have not already done so, Download/clone the Go SDK from:

[<span class="underline">https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk</span>](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand-sdk)

7)  **Review the readme file:**

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](images/media/image39.png)

8)  **In VS Code, open algodclient.go in the VS Code Explorer**

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image40.png)

9)  Your launch.json file should look similar to this:

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](images/media/image41.png)

1.  Select the debugger

2.  Note algodToken

3.  Note MakeClient

4.  Note Status

5.  Run (you may be prompted to open launch.json. After it opens, then
    you need to go back and select algodclient.go again in the Explorer)

6.  Note status info in the debug console

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image42.png)

10) The debug console should show results for creating an algod client,
    algod status and block information.

11) Run as many of the following samples as desired, in this order
    (there is a file for each in a folder in the algosamples/mygodemo
    folder):

### kmdclient.go - kmd client go

The following example creates a wallet and generates an account within
that wallet. This account can now be used to sign transactions, but you
will need some funds to get started. If you are on the test network,
TestNet, you can use
the <span class="underline">[dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) </span>to
seed your account with some Algos.

### backupwallet.go - Backing up a Wallet 

You can export a master derivation key from the wallet and convert it to
a mnemonic phrase in order to back up any generated addresses. This
backup phrase will only allow you to recover wallet-generated keys; if
you import an external key into a kmd-managed wallet, you'll need to
back up that key by itself in order to recover it.

To restore a wallet, convert the phrase to a key and pass it
to CreateWallet. This call will fail if the wallet already exists:

### signsubmit.go - Signing and submitting a transaction

The following example shows how to to use both KMD and Algod when
signing and submitting a transaction. You can also sign a transaction
offline, which is shown in the next section of this document.

### signoffline.go - Sign a transaction offline

The following example shows how to create a transaction and sign it
offline. You can also create the transaction online and then sign it
offline.

### submittransfilefrom.go - Submit the transaction from a file 

This example takes the output from the previous example (file containing
signed transaction) and submits it to Algod process of a node.

### manipulatemultisig.go - Manipulating multisig transactions 

Here, we first create a simple multisig payment transaction, with three
public identities and a threshold of 2.

[**<span class="underline">Skip to next section</span>**](#resources)

    (there is a file for each in a folder):

### AccountTest.java - Generate account and backup phrase 

This example creates a random account, a backup phrase and performs a
recovery

This account can now be used to sign transactions, but you will need
some funds to get started. If you are on the test network, TestNet, you
can use
the <span class="underline">[dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) </span>to
seed your account with some Algos.

### NewWallet.java - kmd client 

The following example creates a wallet and generates an account within
that wallet. This account can now be used to sign transactions, but you
will need some funds to get started. If you are on the test network,
TestNet, you can use
the <span class="underline">[dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) </span>to
seed your account with some Algos.

### BackupWallet.java and RestoreWallet.java - Backing up and restoring a Wallet 

You can export a master derivation key from the wallet and convert it to
a mnemonic phrase in order to back up any generated addresses. This
backup phrase will only allow you to recover wallet-generated keys; if
you import an external key into a kmd-managed wallet, you'll need to
back up that key by itself in order to recover it.

To restore a wallet, convert the phrase to a key and pass it
to CreateWallet. This call will fail if the wallet already exists:

### SignAndSubmit.java - Signing and submitting a transaction

[**<span class="underline">Skip to next section</span>**](#resources)

##   
Python SDK

Time estimate: 20 minutes

###   
example.py

1)  **For the Python samples open folder for mypythondemo into VS Code
    or you favorite IDE  
    **  
    Or just open the python.code-workspace in the algorandsamples folder
    with VS Code.

2)  The Python **launch.json** file should be similar to this:

![A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated](images/media/image45.png)

3)  If not already done, clone or download the Python SDK at:

> [<span class="underline">https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk</span>](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk)

4)  Use the instructions on the readme file to install the SDK

5)  In this section we will run the example.py code from the SDK. Before
    running example.py start kmd and alogd using these goal commands:  
      
    goal kmd start -d \[data directory\]  
      
    goal node start -d \[data directory\]

6)  Next, create a wallet and account, and copy off account address.

goal wallet new \[wallet name\] -d \[data directory\]  
  
goal account new -d \[data directory\] -w \[wallet name\]

7)  Paste the account address into the [Algorand
    <span class="underline">TestNet
    D</span>ispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) to send
    Algos to this account.

8)  Edit params.py and add token information and data-dir-path  
      
    1\) Edit params.py  
    2\) Add token info for algod and kmd  
    3\) Add your data directory path

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image46.png)

9)  Edit example.py  
      
    1\) Edit example.py  
    2\) Uncomment Enter your Wallet, password and account info  
    3\) Comment prompt for these values  
    4\) Run the code and see the results in the Output console

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](images/media/image47.png)

10) The example code performs the following functions:  
      
    Create kmd and algod clients

> Create a new kmd wallet
> 
> Generate an account and import to wallet
> 
> Get the mnemonic
> 
> Get last block
> 
> Create a transaction
> 
> Sign a transaction with kmd
> 
> Sign a transaction with account
> 
> Send the transaction

To see the new wallet and accounts we created use:

goal wallet list -w \[wallet name\] -d data

You should see something like this:

![A close up of a device Description automatically
